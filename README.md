# Django-ReactJs-Boilerplate
A boilerplate for using django and reactjs with webpack
## Creating a Django project
Ensure you have activated the virual environment where you have installed Django and other requirements.
Run `django-admin startapp djbackend` in the terminal to create the django project. I called mine djbackend.
## Setting up webpack
We will be using webpack and Babel for our React app instead of create-react-app.
We'll use npm to manage our frontend dependencies. Ensure you have NodeJs installed in your system.
Let's generate a package.json file in our project root by running `npm init` in the terminal.
### Webpack
Is a module bundler which lets us bundle our project files into a single file.
